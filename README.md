<h2>Description</h2>
üîπ VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
are used to divide a physical network switch into multiple, logical networks. Each VLAN acts like a separate network, isolating traffic and reducing broadcast domains. This improves security, performance, and network manageability.
Example: Devices in the HR department can be placed in VLAN 10, while Finance uses VLAN 20‚Äîeven though they‚Äôre connected to the same physical switch.

üîπ DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
is a Cisco protocol that helps switches automatically decide if a connection should carry traffic for one VLAN (access) or multiple VLANs (trunk). While helpful in test environments, DTP is usually turned off in production for security reasons.
Example: When connecting two Cisco switches, DTP can automatically form a trunk port to allow VLAN traffic to pass between them.

üîπ HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
is a Cisco protocol that allows two or more routers to work together to provide a redundant gateway. One router is active, and another is on standby. If the active one fails, the standby takes over instantly‚Äîusers won‚Äôt notice any interruption.
Example: If the main router goes down, HSRP ensures users can still reach the Internet via a backup router, without changing any settings.

üîπ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
is a dynamic routing protocol that helps routers share and learn routes automatically. It's fast, scalable, and uses a link-state model to find the shortest and most reliable path through the network.
Example: In a large enterprise with dozens of routers, OSPF ensures each one knows the best route to every other network‚Äîwithout manual configuration.

üîπ NAT (Network Address Translation)
allows private IP addresses (used inside a company) to be translated into public IP addresses (used on the Internet). It hides internal network details and helps conserve global IPv4 addresses.
Example: A company with 100 computers can use one public IP address to access the Internet, with NAT translating requests behind the scenes.

üîπ VPN (Virtual Private Network)
creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the Internet, allowing remote users or sites to safely access internal company resources. It protects data from being intercepted or tampered with.
Example: A remote employee uses a VPN to securely connect to their company‚Äôs internal systems from home or while traveling.<br />

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<b>Open Cisco Packet Tracer </b>

<b> Devices Used <b>

- <b> 6 PCs (End-user devices)<b>
- <b> 3 Layer 2 Switches (Access Layer)<b>
- <b> 2 Layer 3 Swiches (HSRP and routing)<b>
- <b> Core & Branch Router (GRE tunnel shown between core router an branch)<b>
- <b> Branch Router (Remote office with servers)<b>
- <b> 1 Internet Cloud (Simulated WAN)<b>
- <b> Various Service Devices (HTTP, TFTP, FTP servers)<b>
- <b> Crossover and straight-through cables were used to connect the devices<b>

<b> End Devices (PCs) and VLANs<b>

<b> Each group of PCs is isolated logically using VLANs to segment traffic and improve security/performance <b>

üü¶ VLAN 10 (Light Blue box)
 - <b> Connected Devices: PC1, PC2<b>
 - <b> VLAN ID: 10<b>
 - <b> Subnet: 192.168.10.0/24<b>
 - <b> Default Gateway: 192.168.10.100 (HSRP virtual IP))<b>
 
üü™ VLAN 20 (Purple box)
 - <b> Connected Devices: PC1, PC2<b>
 - <b> VLAN ID: 10<b>
 - <b> Subnet: 192.168.10.0/24<b>
 - <b> Default Gateway: 192.168.10.100 (HSRP virtual IP))<b>
 
üü© VLAN 30 (Green box)
 -  <b> Connected Devices: PC5, PC6<b>
 - <b> VLAN ID: 30<b>
 - <b> Subnet: 192.168.30.0/24<b>
 - <b> Default Gateway: 192.168.30.100 (HSRP virtual IP))<b>

<b> Layer 2 Switches (Access Switches)<b>

 - <b> Three switches, each handling a single VLAN<b>
 - <b> Switch 1 handles VLAN 10 (PC1, PC2)<b>
 - <b> Switch 2 handles VLAN 20 (PC3, PC4)<b>
 - <b>Switch 3 handles VLAN 30 (PC5, PC6))<b>

 <b>Switches/Routers with HSRP (Active/Standby)<b>
 
üîπ Router/Switch 1 (left): Active-Interface IPs

 - <b> 192.168.10.1<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.1<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.1<b>
 - <b> Participates in HSRP group for each VLAN<b>
 - <b> Handles default gateway duties under normal operation<b>

üîπ Router/Switch 2 ( Right): Standby-Interface IPs

 - <b> 192.168.10.2<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.2<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.2<b>
 - <b> Participates in HSRP group for each VLAN<b>
 - <b> Becomes active if Router/Switch 1 fails<b>

üîπ Virtual IPs via HSRP

 - <b> VLAN 10 Gateway: 192.168.10.100<b>
 - <b> VLAN 20 Gateway: 192.168.20.100<b>
 - <b> VLAN 30 Gateway: 192.168.30.100<b>
 
 <b>Purpose: Provides redundancy. If the Active router fails, the Standby takes over seamlessly for all VLANs<b>
                                                                                                           
<b>Note: Used trunking technology to connect three Layer 2 switches with two Layer 3 switches/routers, enabling the transmission of traffic from multiple VLANs over single physical links between devices. This approach optimized network efficiency and preserved VLAN segmentation throughout the infrastructure<b>

<b>GRE Tunnel & WAN Connectivity<b>

<b>A GRE Tunnel is configured between the core router and the branch router to simulate secure inter-site communication. This tunnel allows VLAN hosts to:<b>

 - <b>Reach the Branch Network 10.1.1.0/24<b>
 - <b>Access remote services (HTTP, FTP, TFTP)<b>
 
 üîπ GRE Tunnel

  GRE Tunnel Interface:

 - <b>From Core Router ‚Üí Branch Router<b>
 - <b>GRE Tunnel IPs:<b>
 - <b>Core side: 172.16.1.1<b>
 - <b>Branch side: 172.16.1.2<b>
 - <b>Tunnel passes over:<b>
 - <b>Serial link: Se0/0/0 from Core ‚Üí Se0/0/0 on Internet (8.8.8.8) ‚Üí to Branch<b>
	
<b>Purpose: Allows internal traffic from VLAN PCs to reach the remote branch securely as if on the same internal network<b>
