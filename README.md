<h2>Description</h2>
ðŸ”¹ VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
VLANs are used to divide a physical network switch into multiple, logical networks. Each VLAN acts like a separate network, isolating traffic and reducing broadcast domains. This improves security, performance, and network manageability.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: Devices in the HR department can be placed in VLAN 10, while Finance uses VLAN 20â€”even though theyâ€™re connected to the same physical switch.

ðŸ”¹ DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
DTP is a Cisco protocol that helps switches automatically decide if a connection should carry traffic for one VLAN (access) or multiple VLANs (trunk). While helpful in test environments, DTP is usually turned off in production for security reasons.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: When connecting two Cisco switches, DTP can automatically form a trunk port to allow VLAN traffic to pass between them.

ðŸ”¹ HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
HSRP is a Cisco protocol that allows two or more routers to work together to provide a redundant gateway. One router is active, and another is on standby. If the active one fails, the standby takes over instantlyâ€”users wonâ€™t notice any interruption.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: If the main router goes down, HSRP ensures users can still reach the Internet via a backup router, without changing any settings.

ðŸ”¹ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol that helps routers share and learn routes automatically. It's fast, scalable, and uses a link-state model to find the shortest and most reliable path through the network.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: In a large enterprise with dozens of routers, OSPF ensures each one knows the best route to every other networkâ€”without manual configuration.

ðŸ”¹ NAT (Network Address Translation)
NAT allows private IP addresses (used inside a company) to be translated into public IP addresses (used on the Internet). It hides internal network details and helps conserve global IPv4 addresses.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: A company with 100 computers can use one public IP address to access the Internet, with NAT translating requests behind the scenes.

ðŸ”¹ VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the Internet, allowing remote users or sites to safely access internal company resources. It protects data from being intercepted or tampered with.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: A remote employee uses a VPN to securely connect to their companyâ€™s internal systems from home or while traveling.
