<h2>Description</h2>
ðŸ”¹ VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
VLANs are used to divide a physical network switch into multiple, logical networks. Each VLAN acts like a separate network, isolating traffic and reducing broadcast domains. This improves security, performance, and network manageability.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: Devices in the HR department can be placed in VLAN 10, while Finance uses VLAN 20â€”even though theyâ€™re connected to the same physical switch.

ðŸ”¹ DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)
DTP is a Cisco protocol that helps switches automatically decide if a connection should carry traffic for one VLAN (access) or multiple VLANs (trunk). While helpful in test environments, DTP is usually turned off in production for security reasons.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: When connecting two Cisco switches, DTP can automatically form a trunk port to allow VLAN traffic to pass between them.

ðŸ”¹ HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
HSRP is a Cisco protocol that allows two or more routers to work together to provide a redundant gateway. One router is active, and another is on standby. If the active one fails, the standby takes over instantlyâ€”users wonâ€™t notice any interruption.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: If the main router goes down, HSRP ensures users can still reach the Internet via a backup router, without changing any settings.

ðŸ”¹ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol that helps routers share and learn routes automatically. It's fast, scalable, and uses a link-state model to find the shortest and most reliable path through the network.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: In a large enterprise with dozens of routers, OSPF ensures each one knows the best route to every other networkâ€”without manual configuration.

ðŸ”¹ NAT (Network Address Translation)
NAT allows private IP addresses (used inside a company) to be translated into public IP addresses (used on the Internet). It hides internal network details and helps conserve global IPv4 addresses.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: A company with 100 computers can use one public IP address to access the Internet, with NAT translating requests behind the scenes.

ðŸ”¹ VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the Internet, allowing remote users or sites to safely access internal company resources. It protects data from being intercepted or tampered with.

ðŸ“Œ Simple Example: A remote employee uses a VPN to securely connect to their companyâ€™s internal systems from home or while traveling.

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<b>Open Cisco Packet Tracer </b>

<b> Devices Used <b>

- <b> 6 PCs (End-user devices)<b>
- <b> 3 Layer 2 Switches (Access Layer)<b>
- <b> 2 Layer 3 Swiches (HSRP and routing)<b>
- <b> Core & Branch Router (GRE tunnel shown between core router an branch)<b>
- <b> Branch Router (Remote office with servers)<b>
- <b> 1 Internet Cloud (Simulated WAN)<b>
- <b> Various Service Devices (HTTP, TFTP, FTP servers)<b>
- <b> Crossover and straight-through cables were used to connect the devices<b>

<b> End Devices (PCs) and VLANs<b>

<b> Each group of PCs is isolated logically using VLANs to segment traffic and improve security/performance <b>

ðŸŸ¦ VLAN 10 (Light Blue box)
 - <b> Connected Devices: PC1, PC2<b>
 - <b> VLAN ID: 10<b>
 - <b> Subnet: 192.168.10.0/24<b>
 - <b> Default Gateway: 192.168.10.100 (HSRP virtual IP))<b>
 
ðŸŸª VLAN 20 (Purple box)
 - <b> Connected Devices: PC1, PC2<b>
 - <b> VLAN ID: 10<b>
 - <b> Subnet: 192.168.10.0/24<b>
 - <b> Default Gateway: 192.168.10.100 (HSRP virtual IP))<b>
 
ðŸŸ© VLAN 30 (Green box)
 -  <b> Connected Devices: PC5, PC6<b>
 - <b> VLAN ID: 30<b>
 - <b> Subnet: 192.168.30.0/24<b>
 - <b> Default Gateway: 192.168.30.100 (HSRP virtual IP))<b>

<b> Layer 2 Switches (Access Switches)<b>

 - <b> Three switches, each handling a single VLAN<b>
 - <b> Switch 1 handles VLAN 10 (PC1, PC2)<b>
 - <b> Switch 2 handles VLAN 20 (PC3, PC4)<b>
 - <b>Switch 3 handles VLAN 30 (PC5, PC6))<b>

 <b>Switches/Routers with HSRP (Active/Standby)<b>
 
ðŸ”¹ Router/Switch 1 (left): Active-Interface IPs

 - <b> 192.168.10.1<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.1<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.1<b>
 - <b> Participates in HSRP group for each VLAN<b>
 - <b> Handles default gateway duties under normal operation<b>

ðŸ”¹ Router/Switch 2 ( Right): Standby-Interface IPs

 - <b> 192.168.10.2<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.2<b>
 - <b> 192.168.10.2<b>
 - <b> Participates in HSRP group for each VLAN<b>
 - <b> Becomes active if Router/Switch 1 fails<b>

ðŸ”¹ Virtual IPs via HSRP

 - <b> VLAN 10 Gateway: 192.168.10.100<b>
 - <b> VLAN 20 Gateway: 192.168.20.100<b>
 - <b> VLAN 30 Gateway: 192.168.30.100<b>
 
 <b>Purpose: Provides redundancy. If the Active router fails, the Standby takes over seamlessly for all VLANs<b>
                                                                                                           
<b>Note: Used trunking technology to connect three Layer 2 switches with two Layer 3 switches/routers, enabling the transmission of traffic from multiple VLANs over single physical links between devices. This approach optimized network efficiency and preserved VLAN segmentation throughout the infrastructure.<b>
